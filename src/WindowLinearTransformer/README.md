### Remark
- For Non-ASCII characters, you need to turn on `Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support` in Region -> Administrative
- You may see `AdjustTokenPrivileges failed: Not all privileges or groups referenced are assigned to the caller.` if you are not opening this program with admin privilege. Some of the programs need admin privilege to transform. Some of the programs cannot be transformed due to **User Interface Privilege Isolation**. You can check the integrity of programs by using **Process Explorer**(`procexp64.exe`[Admin]) in **SysinternalsSuite**. Program with integrity **System**(the only one I know) cannot be transformed.
